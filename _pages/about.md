## HOWDY!

I am Ramana Heggadal Math and I love data, AI, and full-stack development.

I graduated with an MS in Data Science (CSE Focus) from **Texas A&M University**.
 
Currently, my interests lie in scalable data systems, reinforcement learning for autonomous vehicles, LLM inferencing, and applying computer vision/deep learning to agriculture.  

I care for, and strive to build a world that's progressive, fair, and accessible to everyone.

Outside of my professional work, I enjoy playing the violin, experimenting with vegetarian cooking, and going on long walks to think and recharge.  
Iâ€™m also fascinated by how design and simplicity can transform user experiences.
